# mikMattan

Welcome I am lichter4090
This is mikMattan

For playing with some computers in a private network, one computer must run the mikMattanServer.exe file and change the server_info.txt file.
The first field in the server_info.txt is the ip address of the computer that runs the server program (no need to change the other field).

Enjoy!
